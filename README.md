# MintyGrid
MintyGrid is a simple EA that does not use indicators or market averages to trade. MintyGrid always buys and/or sells. On winning trades MintyGrid will take profit based configuration. On loosing trades MintyGrid uses a grid strategy to place resistance points using a martingale/reverse-martingale strategy to be prepared for when the market swings in the opposite direction. MintyGird can be configured to run on many currency pairs simultaneously.

Recommended usage is on a cent account with at least 300 EUR (30000 Euro Cents) and high leverage. Or 30000 EUR on a standard account if you want to take a big risk.

Always backtest before using. It is not recommended to run MintyGrid alongside other EAs.
